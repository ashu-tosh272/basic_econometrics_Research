The study aims to examine the effect of environmental and economic
variables on carbon dioxide emissions in Italy. The study used an auto-regressive
distribution lag (ARDL) approach on a time series of data from 1965 to 2020 to
study the long run and short run association between the variables. In the recent
report published by the World Bank, Italy is ranked 50th with 5.3 metric tonnes
per capita. The findings revealed that coal consumption and GDP have a positive
relationship with CO2 emissions, whereas renewable energy consumption and
agricultural land area have a negative relationship in both the short and long run.
